# Calculator

Simple [calculator](https://konstabartosh.github.io/calculator/)  made on native JavaScript

Things to do:
- You should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.
- Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems!
- Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data.. make sure the user is really starting fresh after pressing “clear”
- Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… and don’t let it crash your calculator!
